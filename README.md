# Erratic Thoughts and More

## Jotting down my screams, one sentence at a time.

As the title reads, you will be immersed in my hikikomori-bedroom-like mess of a mind. Here I write true reflections of what I think and feel. I won't try to be as diplomatic as I am on X or any other platforms.

Well, that's why anyone set up blogs of their own in the first place, right?

So here it is, my honest thoughts on music, design, politics(?), and life in general. All are written with no grammar checks, AI suggestions, or any sort of effort to be aligned with the current trends.
